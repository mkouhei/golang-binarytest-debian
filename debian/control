Description: Helper code for unit testing binary encoding code
 The gobinarytest package is used in testing serialization and
 deserialization. It is particularly useful when some sub-sequences of bytes
 can acceptably be written in any order (e.g if they are generated from
 representations that do not provide order guarantees like maps).
